# Introduction

A simple React app (using Redux) to manage the players of a Cricket Team. It has the following screens.

   - Welcome screen
   - List screen
   - Add player screen

# Installation

This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Gowtham002/players_frontend.git
$ cd players_frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

For production environments...

$ server -s build
```

# Tech

This app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React.js]() - JS library for building UI.
* [Bootstrap]() - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps.
* [Redux]() - a predictable state container for JS apps.
