* [React](https://reactjs.org) - JS library for building UI.
* [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps.
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org) - a predictable state container for JS apps.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - module bundler.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - JS compiler.
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios) - HTTP client.
* [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - Declarative routing for React.
* [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) - Thunk middleware for Redux.
* [Redux Form](https://redux-form.com) - manage forms in Redux.
